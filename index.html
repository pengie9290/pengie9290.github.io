                    <p><u><b>Professions:</b></u> Deceased (Formerly: General of the Fiertan Military, Executive Daedalus Scientist (genetics division))</p>
                    <p><u><b>Family:</b></u> Victor Cromwell (husband), <redacted>[REDACTED]</redacted></p>
                    <p><u><b>Magic Capabilities:</b></u> Obstructive (estimated scale 20.1)</p>
                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> Yvonne Sterling was known to be a cruel and sadistic woman. Given the nature of the murder for which she was executed by King Silvath, it appears her love for her late husband was genuine, despite public opinion believing otherwise. Further details are not known.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Yvonne Sterling possessed the ability to reduce the power of magic cast by those around her (an estimated 15 meter diameter), or even nullify it outright if her target’s magic was weaker than her own. Exact measurements of this power do not match that demonstrated during the Fiertan-Gaelan war, and are therefore likely corrupted or outdated. What made her a threat to us was her innate knowledge of the inner workings of Daedalus, access to our weapons and technology, and complete understanding of exactly how to make use of it. She had no qualms over throwing us under the bus, so to speak, while making use of all the knowledge and resources we once offered.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Cause of Death:</b></u> Sentenced to death in Gaelan court of law and summarily executed.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> Victor Cromwell was a simple man, motivated only by money. His skills were ours so long as we paid well, and they were worth the price. Testimony of captured Fiertan soldiers suggest he deeply loved his wife, enough that her happiness and wellbeing became a motivator more powerful than greed, though only just.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Victor Cromwell possessed great pyrokinetic ability, far greater than expected when it was granted to him. Exact measurements of this power do not match that demonstrated during the Fiertan-Gaelan war, and are therefore likely corrupted or outdated. Cromwell was also a shrewd man, skilled at noting, guarding, and fixing many of the weak points in our supposedly “flawless” security.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> While under Daedalus' employ, Angel Hosanna bore a very cold demeanor, with none of her emotions showing through what was most likely a facade. After having awoken after the Surge, Angel Hosanna’s character appears to have undergone a significant change, now being an incredibly conscientious, caring person seeking redemption for the “evils” performed at her superiors’ commands.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Angel Hosanna possesses electromagnetic magic. While this power appears above average, it is nothing unusual. The origin of this magic is unknown, but is speculated to be a result of the Surge.</p>

                    <p>Subject's pyrokinetic magic is recorded reaching temperatures as high as 3245.81 K and is recorded reaching a range of 63.4m. Subject's only recorded uses of pyrokinetic magic have been launched from the mouth akin to a flamethrower.</p>

                    <p>At the moment, this subject is the only one of its kind, but it shows promise for potential military applications.

Military application is currently awaiting approval from Dr. Thorne.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Containment Procedures:</b></u></p>
                    <p>As the subject is not capable of locomotion out of the water, it is to be kept unrestrained within a water tank with approximate dimensions 60m x 30m x 15m. An artificial current is to flow through this tank at all times, so as to pass oxygen over the subject’s gills. Nutrients are to be dropped into the tank through the use of a crane. Personnel are not to approach within 10 meters of the tank unless the subject has been tranquilized.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Notes:</b></u></p>
                    <p>The subject’s ability to turn functionally invisible in the dark will make it incredibly difficult to examine- and more importantly control- in field tests. Are you sure utilizing this thing is truly a good idea, Dr. Thorne? I’m proud the subject could be created, but I do not see any way deploying this subject will not come back to bite us, possibly in a literal sense. I am formally requesting this project be discontinued for our own safety and security’s sake.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> At Dr. Sterling’s request, all experimentation and related testing regarding #E-C-7423697 is now discontinued. The subject will be euthanized shortly.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum #2 by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> The subject’s Chemical magic appears to have rendered it immune to euthanization. In light of this, the currents in the subject’s tank will be deactivated and the subject will no longer be fed, so it either suffocates or starves to death instead. We will not waste resources and the safety of personnel on causing the death of this subject.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> Kind and honest to a fault. Places the well-being of his people, and to a lesser extent the world as a whole, above his own. Appears to suffer a severe case of survivor’s guilt.                </p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Silvath’s pyrokinetic magic appears comparable to that of an #E-C-4633766 specimen (Fire Beast), and can likely burn through even the best shielding we have produced in seconds. Silvath lacks a detailed understanding of human biology and thus cannot utilize chemical magic to heal others effectively, but is still capable of unconsciously healing lesser wounds on his own body, as well as poisons. Silvath is well-versed in melee combat and military tactics, having led a military composed mostly of untrained civilians to victory in the only war since the new world began.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Response:</b></u> Edrick Silvath is not a threat that can be opposed directly. Between Silvath’s guards and his own martial and magical prowess, any attempted assassination is likely to end in failure. Silvath and his forces fought and killed multiple escaped Fire Beasts during the war, so it is unlikely a military strike will be capable of putting him down either. Our objectives do not require us to oppose King Silvath on Gaelan soil, and thus the best course of action for combating him is simply to avoid conflict. Should he seek it out himself on foreign soil, it will be us deciding the terrain, and where every advantage sans numbers will be in our favor.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Document ID:</b></u> #DOC-3376263</p>
                    <p><u><b>Age:</b></u> 43 (claimed)</p>
                    <p><u><b>Profession:</b></u> Councilor in the Knights of Solaris</p>
                    <p><u><b>Magic Capabilities:</b></u> Pyrokinetic (estimated natural output 14.3; estimated functional output 42.3)</p>
                    <p><u><b>History:</b></u> Fernand Aranae’s origin, childhood, adolescence, and early adult life could not be determined. Aranae made himself known to the Knights of Solaris by defending a town whose militia was bedridden due to plague, aided only by his (now deceased) wife. Due to both his mind, power, and dedication, he rose up the ranks of the Knights and was granted the position of Councilor after ten years of service.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> In public, Fernand Aranae wears a calm and gentle persona. This is a facade to conceal his violent and aggressive true nature. The man’s kindness does appear to be genuine, however. It has been noted that personal slights against him seem to have little to no effect, but the mere suggestion of harming an innocent can elicit a reaction which may cause significant property damage.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Due to his intense and ever-present rage, Fernand Aranae appears to have shattered his body’s natural limiter, resulting in his magic being permanently locked in the critical condition. As a result, Aranae’s pyrokinetic magic actually overshadows that of even a Fire Beast. This is a double-edged sword however, as Aranae struggles to control his magic, and has been reported losing control entirely, casting nonstop until passing out from overexertion. Aranae appears skilled in swordplay and flight on wyvernback, but not to the level of a trained soldier.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Response:</b></u> Aranae cannot be killed in a direct confrontation. Assassination is not impossible, but due to his position it will be difficult to accomplish. However, Aranae is currently leading the military aspect of the Knights of Solaris’ campaign against us. If we can only ascertain when and where he and his forces will strike next, it will be an easy matter for a sniper to eliminate him.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> An informant reported recently with “This man has never smiled in his life.” A crude statement, to be sure, but one that seems to match both the public’s opinion and that of those close to him. Highly cautious and dedicated to his work.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Dr. Nathan Aldritch is without question the most powerful user of chemical magic ever recorded. He has also been shown to be competent at cracking the encryption on our files and deciphering their contents. Since he appeared in the public eye during the war between Fierte and Gaela, several diseases have all but disappeared, thanks not only to his incredible power but also the medical techniques and procedures learned from studying our records. Thousands of people across the world owe him their lives.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Response:</b></u> Given the man’s blatantly absurd magical ability, it is unclear whether we possess a weapon which can actually kill him. However, his cautious, reclusive nature and refusal to travel anywhere without a highly-armed guard renders this ability practically irrelevant. That said, our best chance of seeing the man dead is likely just to wait for old age to put him down for us.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Location:</b></u> 49.895, -287.413</p>
                    <p><u><b>Magic Capabilities:</b></u> Chemical (hypothesized, estimated scale 273)</p>
                    <p><u><b>Scale:</b></u> Height 97m; Trunk Diameter 31m; Inner Hollow Diameter 19m</p>
                    <p><u><b>Reproductive Capabilities:</b></u> The subject appears incapable of reproduction. A full examination cannot be performed, therefore this remains theoretical.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Description:</b></u> This subject is a large tree in southwest Gaela, just north of the Marillan territory. It bears a large hollow in the center of its trunk, which was repurposed into a stronghold occupied by bandits until the Fiertan/Gaelan war. It appears to have sprouted from pre-Surge Production Facility #4325. This facility was designed to mass-produce synthesized chemical magic, all of which appears to have been absorbed by the subject. This is speculated to be the reason this subject has grown to such an abnormal scale, and at such an abnormal rate.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u> The subject is all but impervious to harm. This is because the subject appears to have developed the ability to heal itself at an abnormal rate, most likely as a result of consuming synthesized chemical magic. Even simply obtaining samples of the subject’s bark proved difficult to achieve, and attempts to sample the wood beneath have ended in failure, as any cut we make is healed over before samples can be extracted. This subject has shown no signs of intelligence, and by thus no signs of being capable of utilizing this chemical magic to harm. Despite the interior having been converted into a stronghold, the subject shows no signs of infection or illness, past or present. All attempts to damage the subject with magic have ended in failure.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Details:</b></u> Though this subject is an organism, due to its scale and unique nature it has been classified as a location. This subject grew out of a production facility immediately adjacent to Examination Facility #348463, in which Subjects #E-D-1 and #E-D-2 were contained. It is a common belief that this subject is the birthplace of the goddesses Solaris and Eclipse. Though this belief is clearly false; if #E-D-1 and #E-D-2 escaped containment following the beginning of the subject’s growth, this would explain the belief’s origin. Will attempt to confirm or deny this theory in the near future.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Location ID:</b></u> #X-L-4753</p>
                    <p><u><b>Common Name:</b></u> The Barren Isle</p>
                    <p><u><b>Public Knowledge:</b></u> The Barren Isle is an uninhabited island off the northeast shore of Gaela. Little to no life lives on the island or in the surrounding waters. Dead, dried out vegetation can be found all over the island. Reportedly, desiccated carcasses of wildlife could also be found near the shore before the Holy Order arrived, took hold of the empty Facility #27325 for their own purposes, and removed them. Those who have been on the island reportedly often find themselves incapable of using magic. The majority of the island is covered in a forest of dead trees. There are no known records or folktales of people entering this forest ever returning.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u></p>
                    <p>All wireless communications cut out before reaching the island’s shore, and are impossible to reestablish without first moving a certain distance from the island. The use of drones to conduct unmanned surveys of the island is impossible. Just past the island’s shore, the same occurs for all electronic equipment. Though dead, the forest’s trees are too densely packed together to make out any significant details from afar. Seven parties have entered the forest to conduct examinations and collect samples. The party tasked with searching only a few meters past the forest’s perimeter is the only one to have returned. All employees who have set foot and remained on the island for longer than a day have reported feeling ill, but have not known how to describe their symptoms in detail. Each has undergone medical examinations following their return, and not one showed any sign of illness or injury.</p>
                    <p>Samples have been collected including animal carcasses found just within the forest’s perimeter, pieces of vegetation, and several soil, rock, and water samples collected from all over the island. Barring the stomachs of the animal carcasses, no signs of decomposition have been found. All microorganisms found within collected samples appear to be as dead as the macroorganisms also collected.Carbon dating of the samples reveals that the death of every sample occurred approximately 1000 years ago.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Conclusions:</b></u></p>
                    <p>Given the location of Facility #27325 on this island, what’s left of Facility #32387 must also be on this island, near the center in the depths of the forest. As Facility #32387 was the site at which Subject #E-D-3 was created, and by extension the origin point of The Surge, a number of conclusions can be drawn. The deaths of the organisms on this island was likely caused by the Surge itself. There appears to be some form of energy radiating from the center of this island which slowly kills organisms living on it. This explains why no decomposition has occurred, as no foreign microorganisms carried by the wind or water can survive long enough to decompose anything. This energy is likely also the cause of both our equipment malfunctions and the dysfunctionality of magic while on the island.</p>
                    <p>As our equipment cannot function on the island, we are incapable of positively identifying the nature of this energy, though it is undoubtedly magic in nature. However, a likely hypothesis has been formed. Given the unique nature of this energy, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world, the source of it must be one-of-a-kind. Most likely, this energy emanates directly from Subject #E-D-3 itself, hidden in the depths of the island’s impassable forest.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Common Name:</b></u> The Carved Sea</p>
                    <p><u><b>Location:</b></u> Subject is located between Fierte and Gaela, and is far too large to be done justice with coordinates.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Description:</b></u> A large body of water separating Fierte and Gaela, and serving as the primary trade route between the two countries. Storms out on this sea are known to be rare, but incredibly dangerous even by the standards of typical maritime storms. According to both the Holy Order’s religious texts and #E-D-2’s own account, this sea was carved out of the continent by a battle between #E-D-1 and #E-D-2 approximately 450 years ago, or 570 years following the Surge. Perdix Isle is the sole landmass located in this sea, though was not present until 13 years ago.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u> The waters in this sea are quite toxic, likely being filled with sediment from the decimated rock and soil resulting from #E-D-1 and #E-D-2’s battle. Due to the water’s toxicity, it is ill suited for sustaining life. A notable exception to this is right along the shores of Fierte, Gaela, and Perdix, where bivalves such as clams and oysters have been transplanted and begun spreading for the express purpose of cleaning the waters.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Conclusions:</b></u> Nothing about this subject is relevant to Daedalus’ operations, but it will be interesting to observe how the efforts to clean the waters play out, and how far the habitable zone can be expanded.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Details:</b></u> Following the recent repairs of some critical equipment, there is reason to believe #E-D-0 may lie somewhere at the bottom of #X-L-7327. All attempts to reach the seafloor with a submarine have ended in failure. The wreckage of two of the seventeen dispatched submarines has been located, and appears to have been torn apart by some sort of organism. Tooth marks seem to be an approximate match for data regarding the jaw of #E-C-7423697. Investigating the organism responsible for destroying our vehicles and exploring #X-L-7327 to locate #E-D-0 is now Daedalus’ top priority.</p>

The subject is capable of altering this false body as they see fit, and appears to only restrains themselves to one form by choice. The subject’s core has been recorded moving of its own accord without a false body, and appears unaffected by gravity. All attempts to determine the molecular composition of both the subject’s core and false body have failed.</p>
                    <p><u><b>History:</b></u> According to mythology and research, #E-D-1 and #E-D-2 predate the human race.

                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> Highly sadistic. During cooperation before the subject’s capture, attempts to conceal unrelated experiments and test subjects failed. Contrary to expectations, witnessing the suffering inflicted on test subjects appeared to bolster #E-D-1’s respect for Daedalus and willingness to cooperate.

                    <p>After escaping containment, #E-D-1 chose to aid humanity. #E-D-1 carved out a plateau to the Northeast on which the city Ecleau could be built and gathered human survivors to them, teaching them to use the magic they developed as a result of the Surge. Approximately two centuries after the Surge, #E-D-1 and #E-D-2 clashed once again, resulting in the carving of an ocean that did not previously exist. Realizing they could not continue their battle without further endangering those they had chosen to aid and protect, both retreated, leaving the humans they had aided to survive on their own merits.</p>
                    <p>1013 years after the surge, both subjects returned. #E-D-2’s followers had formed the country Fierte and created a religion around them known as the “Holy Order of Solaris”, and had begun attempting to conquer the world in their goddess’ name, to “spread her glory” and all those other excuses power-hungry zealots spout. #E-D-1 caught wind of this and began aiding their efforts in secret, despite being known as the religion’s archenemy. Following the war between Gaela and Fierte, #E-D-1 was captured and restrained in Facility 463, and sentenced to be executed should a possible method be discovered.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Subject:</b></u> #E-D-3</p>
                    <p><u><b>Given Name:</b></u> Daeus</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> This name originates from a misspelling of the term “Deus”. I do not understand why so many employees have grown attached to this name, nor do I care to.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Magic Capabilities:</b></u> Creation (scale 4637), Destruction (scale 4637)</p>
                    <p><u><b>Biology:</b></u> The subject’s true body- referred to as its “core”- is a sphere 15cm diameter. It is speculated that the subject is capable of forming a false body similar to #E-D-1, but this is not confirmed.</p>
                    <p><u><b>History:</b></u> The subject was created by Daedalus with magic extracted from #E-D-1 and #E-D-2, following extensive research into both. Upon completion of the project, the subject released a burst of energy which demolished Facility 522 and spread across the world.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum #2 by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> This burst of energy has come to be known as “The Surge”.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> The subject is speculated to be capable of identical magical feats as #E-D-1 and #E-D-2, albeit with only half the power. Prototypes have accomplished similar feats on much smaller scales, but this merely supports the hypothesis, rather than confirm it. Unless the Surge is to be counted as a feat, the subject has no recorded feats.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u> N/A; No examinations were able to be performed.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Containment Procedures:</b></u> Keep the subject’s core contained within a custom-built capsule (which must contain a functional Magic Seal) at all times. Keep the capsule in a containment chamber with a secondary Magic Seal whenever possible as an additional precaution. All procedures listed are speculative, as they have never had a chance to be put to use on this particular subject.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Post-Surge History:</b></u> There have been no traces of #E-D-3 since the Surge. Their history and whereabouts are currently unknown, though they are speculated to lie beneath #X-L-4753.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Biology:</b></u> Unknown. Distant observations indicate a core approximately 0.93 meters in diameter. The subject has not been observed moving or making use of a false body, but it is hypothesized that the subject is capable of doing so.</p>
                    <p><u><b>History:</b></u> Unknown. (Post-Surge Update: #E-D-2 has stated that the subject is the creator of both #E-D-1 and #E-D-2, in addition to the world itself. The accuracy of this statement has not yet been determined.)</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability:</b></u> Unknown. It is speculated that this subject’s ability may be limited only by its perception and imagination, as opposed to any physical limitation.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Ethan Thorne:</b></u> Traces of power emanating from #E-D-0 have been detected, originating at the bottom of #X-L-7327. Due to some sort of interference, hypothesized to possibly be connected in some way to #E-C-7423697, the emanations origin point has not been successfully investigated.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Key Details:</b></u> I am Dr. Ethan Thorne. If you are reading this document, I am likely dead, and Daedalus destroyed, and all my hard work has been for naught. If this is not the case, your device is broadcasting a signal to every one of our facilities at this moment, and aerial bombardment will be deployed at your location shortly. But if it is true, and I have well and truly failed, I can only presume you were my enemy, in which case: congratulations.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Details:</b></u> I am not a petty man. The chip containing the access code to this document you no doubt found during my autopsy also contains the coordinates to a facility even my own employees are unaware of. In this facility, you will find a list of coordinates for every Daedalus facility still operational. It also contains the access code to a list of every employee past and present to ever work for Daedalus. My part in this conflict has ended; the least I can do is allow a swift resolution.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Conclusion:</b></u> This is likely the part where I should apologize and air my grievances or something, but I don’t care. Words of those natures are meaningless, especially from me. If I am dead, it will be without any worthless feelings like guilt, only regretting the countermeasures I failed to take that would have ensured my success. To the world I’ve left behind and everything and everyone in it, goodbye and good riddance.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Average Weight:</b></u> <redacted>[FOLLOWING 'WEIGHT' DATA IS CORRUPTED AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED]</redacted></p>
                    <p><u><b>Recorded Maximum Velocity:</b></u> 48kmh grounded, 97kmh in flight</p>
                    <p><u><b>Reproductive capabilities:</b></u> Untested; hypothesized to be similar to reptiles</p>
                    <p><u><b>Post-Surge Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> Recent studies have concluded that these subjects are capable of sexual reproduction, and lay eggs. No specimens have yet been captured for study, so in-depth observations are currently little more than hearsay, and not worth mentioning.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Genetic Material:</b></u> Body spliced from Equus Caballus, Ouroborus Cataphractus, Crocodylus Porosus, and Ursus Arctos Horribilis; Wings spliced from Diomedea Exulans and Pteropus; Brain spliced from Orcinus Orca, Pan Troglodytes, and <redacted>[FOLLOWING 'GENETIC MATERIAL' DATA IS CORRUPTED AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED]</redacted></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u></p>
                    <p>#E-C-998376 specimens have demonstrated incredible intelligence and problem-solving skills, matching and even outperforming several young adolescent humans which underwent the same examinations.</p>
                    <p>Subjects’ wings do not appear powerful enough to support the specimens bodies without the use of kinetic magic.</p>
                    <p>Most specimens, through the use of kinetic magic, can carry the weight of their bodies and up to two adult humans in flight.</p>
                    <p>Subjects are capable of <redacted>[FOLLOWING ‘EXAMINATION RESULTS’ DATA IS CORRUPTED AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED]</redacted></p>
                    <p>Post-Surge Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne: It appears the escaped subjects have been affected by the Surge, granting them and their descendants additional variants of magic in addition to kinetic. As human test subjects have not been capable of surviving the injecting and processing of additional magic variants, this unique trait is something we wish to study. Unfortunately, this will not be easy, as capturing a wild specimen will bring the entire species to our doorstep, and no human or chimeric riders would ever consider granting us access to one.</p>
                    <p>Post-Surge Addendum #2 by Dr. Ethan Thorne: The descendants of the original escaped specimens living in the wild have demonstrated nearly levels of organization and communication preceded only by humans. Despite living mostly solitary lives, they maintain a network of communications spanning the country of Gaela, and can and will leave their territories to aid other specimens in the event one is in danger. In certain locations in Gaela, these specimens- despite being wild animals- are even beginning to integrate into human society, some even forming seemingly equal partnerships with human soldiers. Though Daedalus machinery is more useful, the power and versatility of a #E-C-998376 specimen ridden by a trained human soldier is not to be underestimated.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Containment Procedures:</b></u></p>
                    <p>Specimens are to be kept shackled in cells affected by magic seals. To be transported, specimens must be tranquilized, have muzzles attached, and be accompanied by at least one member of security wielding firearms with armor-piercing rounds from a distance. Water and nutrients are to be delivered in bags through special chutes built into each cell.</p>
                    <p>Post-Surge Addendum #3 by Dr. Ethan Thorne: Daedalus does not currently have any #E-C-998376 specimens in our possession. However, once we do obtain one, we must ensure their cells are soundproof, as they possess powerful auditory receptors and could call both the entire species- and by extension the Gaelan military- to our doorstep from within their cell.</p>

                    <p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u>
                    <p>The subject’s chemical magic has proven to be something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, the subject has demonstrated an honestly ridiculous capacity for repairing damage to its own body. On the other hand, the subject has also demonstrated such an absurd metabolism that they are not physically capable of gaining nutrition from food, only surviving because their chemical magic repairs all damage to their body that this condition ought to be causing. The subject is physically incapable of growing or developing past the stage of their life they are currently in, and will likely never reach even the minimum size or weight of a healthy adult specimen of any species its genetic makeup contains the DNA of.</p>
                    <p>Behaviorally, the subject is reminiscent of a young dog, in a state of constant excitement and play when not too exhausted to move.</p>
                    <p>The subject appears to have an insatiable appetite, likely due to its inability to absorb nutrients. Food appears to be an excellent motivator for this subject, though it has proven difficult to coerce the subject into performing any desired actions, as this subject only cares for the food being offered as opposed to what we will give it in response to.</p>
                    <p>On the topic of motivation, it is unclear if the subject is capable of experiencing pain. At the very least, all attempts to condition it via such means have ended in abject failure.</p>
                    <p>The subject has demonstrated no inclination towards violence or aggression of any sort.</p>
                    <p>The subject has not demonstrated any capacity for using its chemical magic deliberately, only doing so unconsciously for the sake of treating its own body.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Containment Procedures:</b></u> Given the subject’s size and temperament, a simple cage- one that would typically be used for a small dog- is all that is needed.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Post-Surge Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> The subject has recently been discovered by non-employees in a laboratory which lost contact with our mainframe, and subsequently adopted as a pet and named “Cana”. The subject is not an important enough specimen to waste resources recovering, so this subject’s containment procedures are now irrelevant.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Notes:</b></u> This subject is far from the living superweapon we had hoped it to be. Though its ability to heal itself is unprecedented, it is far too small and weak to inflict any significant damage on anything, and lacks the temperament to even try. That said, several of my subordinates have raised objections to the prospect of having the subject terminated. The primary argument for the subject’s continued existence is a chance to continue observing how such high levels of chemical magic impact the growth of a creature without the intelligence to use it consciously, though I suspect this is merely an excuse to keep the subject around.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u>  I have no objection to refraining from having the subject terminated, but only on the condition that all care for the subject be given by employees during their free time, and all resources spent on the subject’s care come out of said employees’ paychecks. If our employees wish to care for this subject purely at their own expense, and not at the expense of Daedalus, I see no reason to refuse their wish. However, I do want the subject injected with a tracking chip, in case an employee gets the bright idea to steal the subject and present it to some unaffiliated organization as their own creation.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Yvonne Sterling:</b></u> I have injected the subject with a chip containing a tracker and microphone, so if the scenario Dr. Thorne detailed does occur, we will be aware of exactly what sort of interactions took place around the subject. No employees have been informed of this chip’s injection.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Magic Capabilities:</b></u> Electromagnetic (scale 54.7);</p>
                    <p><u><b>Scale:</b></u> Height 0.61m; Length 1.28m</p>
                    <p><u><b>Weight:</b></u> 3.83kg</p>
                    <p><u><b>Reproductive capabilities:</b></u> None. Subject lacks any reproductive organs, and is incapable of asexual reproduction.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Genetic Material:</b></u> Body spliced from Leiurus Quinquestriatus and Electrophorus Voltai, in addition to custom-built genetic sequences</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u></p>
                    <p>The subject is over twenty times the size of the species which the subject’s general body structure is based on. For this reason, the subject’s natural methods of locomotion are incapable of moving its body. As expected, mechanical enhancements are required to make this subject in any way functional.</p>
                    <p>Mechanical enhancements have been created for the subject. By detecting movement in the subject’s limbs and tail, external hydraulics anchored to the subject’s exoskeleton extend and retract in a manner mirroring the subject’s own body, allowing the subject locomotion. These enhancements siphon the subject’s Electromagnetic magic to remain powered indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>As expected, the subject shows no signs of intelligence beyond aggressive, rudimentary survival instincts. Training of this subject is suspected to be incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible.</p>
                    <p>Despite lacking the intelligence required to make use of magic, the subject is capable of utilizing its Electromagnetic magic nonetheless. This is most likely due to the modifications to its nervous system and organ structure created from genetic material of Electrophorus Voltai. This was hypothesized before the subject’s creation, and while we cannot outright confirm this without further testing, the hypothesis looks promising.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to expectations, the subject’s tail does not appear capable of producing or injecting venom. However, the subject- with the aid of mechanical enhancements- is still capable of wielding it as a piercing weapon. Additionally, the subject also appears to use it in a manner similar to how humans and chimeras often utilize their limbs to conduct and direct Electromagnetic magic.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Containment Procedures:</b></u></p>
                    <p>The subject has an aversion to bright light. A simple darkened cell should be enough to contain it. The subject can additionally be connected to the power grid of whatever facility it’s contained in, sapping its Electromagnetic magic to render it unusable while also increasing the power the facility can draw from. For transportation purposes, a remote sequence can be used to deactivate the subject’s mechanical enhancements, rendering it immobile, and possible to transport by hand while under a Magic Seal’s effects.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Notes:</b></u> This subject was created with the express purpose of combating #DOC-545537. This subject is scheduled to be mass-produced and shipped in bulk to every Daedalus facility still operational. The current plan is that in the event of an attack by #DOC-545537, the power being cut will activate a timer with a sort of dead man’s switch. Should the timer reach a certain threshold without being manually deactivated, a hidden isolated system will release several dozen #X-E-C-86786473 specimens throughout the facility. As most employees should be safely within containment cells by this point, as per the demands issued by #DOC-545537, Daedalus employees and test subjects should remain safe, with only #DOC-545537 and their potential unknown allies facing the danger these subjects pose.</p>

                    <p><u><b>History:</b></u> Unknown</p>
                    <p><u><b>Personality:</b></u> Clearly bears an intense hatred for Daedalus. Appears to show sympathy for test subjects. No further data is known.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability (known):</b></u> On 57 occasions (to date), this person has infiltrated a Daedalus laboratory in the night, shut off all lights in the facility, reprogrammed all security systems to lock employees in place, cut off all external communications, and hijacked the intercom to demand unconditional surrender. Not once have they been detected by any security system, inside or outside the building. Some hours later, a flare is sighted rising from the site of the laboratory. When local law enforcement arrives on the scene, nearly all employees are found dead. Only the test subjects and employees who locked themselves in empty cells designed for test subjects (as per the infiltrator’s demands) are found alive. The most detail any autopsy performed by Daedalus or our enemies in their investigation has managed to determine is that our employees’ bodies “fell apart”.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Capability (speculated):</b></u> This person’s abilities appear similar to two variants of magic both commonly referred to as “Shadow” magic. At present, we have not successfully developed a procedure to instill these variants of magic within live subjects, but they are used in certain technologies we’ve only recently perfected. The first of these enables the user to create a field which destroys the bonds holding molecules to one another. We utilize a machine which creates an immobile, paper-thin field to cut metal. If used on a human body, the result would quite literally be the body “falling apart”. The second of these is the ability to cast a similar field around an object, just above its surface, which absorbs any energy that hits it. If a human being had this ability, they would not only be virtually invisible in the dark, but would also be virtually immune to both magic and our energy-based weaponry, at least for a time. The masks worn by our assassins and covert ops teams all make use of this magic. If this person DOES possess these abilities, it would finally explain, at least in part, how they are able to successfully carry out their attacks.</p>

                    <p><u><b>Report Author:</b></u> Dr. Yvonne Sterling</p>
                    <h1><img src="./images/Obstructive_Beast.png" alt="Obstructive Beast Photograph"></h1>
                    <p><u><b>Subject:</b></u> #E-C-8642676</p>
                    <p><u><b>Common Name:</b></u> Obstructive Beast</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Yvonne Sterling:</b></u> These subjects were created after working hours, when a group of inebriated employees got it into their heads to try and recreate the formerly-fictional unicorn using Daedalus resources. I was unaware of this until after the subjects had been created. All employees involved have come forth and confessed of their own volition. I am formally requesting their punishment be limited to being reprimanded and banned from consumption of alcohol, as opposed to more drastic forms of retribution.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> These subjects are ridiculous, but having read this report I do see some- albeit very little- merit in their study. The responsible employees will be reprimanded and forbidden from consumption of alcohol as you have requested, but will also suffer their pay being halved for the next thirty days. If they have any objections to this, they are welcome to waive your request and face the retribution they would have otherwise met.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Average Magic Capabilities:</b></u> Obstructive (scale 12.7)</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Yvonne Sterling:</b></u> In their drunken stupor, these subjects’ creators purportedly selected the first synthesized vial of magic they could. No intelligent thought was put into the magic capabilities granted to these subjects.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Average Scale:</b></u> Height 2.032m; Length 2.714m; Tusk 0.731m</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Yvonne Sterling:</b></u> Even while drunk, these imbeciles at least had the foresight to significantly shorten the length of the tusk. An actual narwhal tusk could be anywhere between 0.5 to 1.5 times the length of the subjects’ own bodies.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Yvonne Sterling:</b></u> I retract my previous statement. These drunken employees only developed this foresight AFTER creating a subject with a full-sized tusk. This particular subject could not lift its head off the ground to move or eat due to the weight and length of the tusk, and has been put out of its misery.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Average Weight:</b></u> 407 kg</p>
                    <p><u><b>Reproductive capabilities:</b></u> Untested; hypothesized to be similar to normal horses.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Post-Surge Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> These subjects escaped containment at some point following the Surge, and have hunted most species of horse in Fierte to extinction. There are more of these subjects in the capital city alone than there ever were in containment, not even counting the specimens found in other cities and in the wild. Clearly, these subjects are capable of reproduction.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Genetic Material:</b></u> Genetics for the overall body structure spliced from Equus Ferus Caballus; genetics for the body’s modification spliced from Monodon Monoceros, with some custom modifications.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Examination Results:</b></u> These subjects appear fairly physically comparable to the horses their genetics were spliced from. The large tusk on their head does not appear to impede their ability to eat, drink, and move as much as anticipated. The subjects have shown signs of being capable of utilizing their haphazardly-granted obstructive magic, but their actual magical power appears relatively low.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Post-Surge Addendum #2 by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> Though these subjects have apparently proven difficult to tame, they have been tamed successfully by the Fiertan military, which employs them as a more effective substitute for the warhorses these subjects drove to extinction.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Containment Procedures:</b></u> Each subject wears a remote-activated shock collar that tases the wearers. Employees are only to enter the subjects’ enclosure while wearing body armor, and while a second employee watches from outside with the remote, in case of emergencies. An automated system delivers food and water to the subjects’ enclosure, so as to keep employees out of harm’s way as much as possible.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><u><b>Additional Notes:</b></u> These drunken idiots managed to give the horses the narwhal tusks they’d wanted, but somehow managed to give them narwhal digestive systems as well. And when they realized this, instead of fixing their mistake, they instead made the subjects’ digestive systems capable of less specialized diets. THEY MADE CARNIVOROUS UNICORNS THAT EAT ANY MEAT WE PUT IN FRONT OF THEM. When I’m done filing this report I’m getting a <redacted>[REDACTED]</redacted> drink, and no, I don’t care how unprofessional it is to include this detail.</p>
                    <p><u><b>Addendum by Dr. Ethan Thorne:</b></u> ...I will let this unprofessionalism slide, but only this once.</p>
